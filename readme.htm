         The ATM Fraud Demo
      </h1>
      <p>
		The ATM Fraud demo shows Apama's discrete event matching capability in performing 
		fraud detection by analyzing ATM (Automated Teller Machine) withdrawal patterns using Apama queries. The queries
		can be parameterized to add thresholds/constraints for the alerts to be triggered. 
      </p>
      <p>
		The demo contains a monitor that generates ATM withdrawal events, both
		from genuine users, and from users committing two different types of fraud. 
		All users move at varying speeds around a network of 400 ATMs making 
		withdrawals for varying amounts.
      </p>
      <p>
		The first type of fraud involves a gang of users who possess several cloned cards.
		The query attempts to detect this by searching for transactions using
		the same card number that occur within a suspiciously short time interval
		at different machines, the assumption being that at least one of the transactions
		will be by a fraudster using the cloned card. The other withdrawal may be by the 
		genuine holder of the card. Both queries output warning events when a 
		potential fraud is detected so that authorities can take further action.
      </p>
      <p>
		The second type of fraud is where a user repeatedly withdraws large amounts
		from a single ATM within a short time period using a stolen card, in
		an attempt to withdraw as many funds as possible before the card is blocked.
		The query that detects possible frauds of this type looks for three large 
		withdrawals at a single machine within a short time period.      
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The queries use a Metadata section to store various pieces of information about them,
		which are then available in the Scenario Browser and may also be exposed in Apama
   		dashboards.

      <p>
		On launching the ATM Fraud demo, the ATM Fraud dashboard is opened in the Dashboard Viewer. Observe that withdrawal events 
		are being generated and fraudulent withdrawals are also being detected.
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li>
			Repeated withdrawal fraud alerts are generated using <code>RepeatedMaxWithdrawals.qry</code> where <strong>threshold</strong> is set to 600 ($ USD) by default.
		</li>
		<li>
			Improbable withdrawal location fraud alerts are generated using <code>ImprobableWithdrawal.qry</code> where <strong>speed_limit</strong> is set to 100.0 (kilometers per hour) by default.
